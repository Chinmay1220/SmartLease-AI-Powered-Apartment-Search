# Final Project - SmartLease: AI-Powered Apartment Search

 **Background:**

The current landscape of online apartment hunting is often characterised by some complex and time consuming filtering processes. The Users typically navigate through multiple dropdown menus, checkboxes and sliders in order to specify their desired location, cost range, property type and amenities. This multi-step process can be frustrating, time consuming and inefficient, especially for those who have a clear idea of what they're looking for but struggle to translate it into the rigid structure of traditional search filters. So the need for a more intuitive AI backed approach to apartment searching has become increasingly apparent as renters seek faster, more efficient ways to find their ideal homes.

**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to revolutionize the apartment search experience by developing an advanced search platform that leverages Large Language Models. This system aims to allow users to input their requirements in a conversational, sentence-form manner, eliminating the need for manual filter selection.

**By doing so, our project seeks to:**

Simplify the search process, making it user-friendly.

Reduce the time and effort required to find suitable apartment listings.

Improve the accuracy of search results by better understanding user search.

**Current Challenges:**


Overloading of Information: Traditional apartment search platforms overwhelm users with an abundance of listings, making it difficult to find truly suitable options.

Personalization limitation: Existing platforms rely heavily on basic filters.

Process is time consuming: Users spend excessive time manually filtering through irrelevant listings.

**Opportunities:**

Our AI-driven approach can reduce the time users spend searching for suitable apartments and by providing personalized relevant search results, we can significantly improve user satisfaction.

**Expected Benefits:**

Simple User Experience:

Provides a more intuitive and personalised apartment search process which reduce user frustration associated with complex filtering systems.

Time Savings:

Significantly reduce the time users spend searching for suitable apartments and allow users to make faster, more informed decisions about potential homes.

Operational Efficiency:

Reduce manual data processing and update efforts through automated pipelines, Minimise costs through efficient use of cloud resources.

Scalability:

Easily expand to new geographic areas without significant infrastructure changes.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, our project proposes an innovative solution to revolutionise the apartment search process using advanced AI technologies. The key points of the proposal are:

The project aims to develop an AI based apartment search platform that leverages Large Language Models and agentic architecture.

It addresses current challenges in apartment hunting, such as information overload, limited personalization, and time-consuming processes.

This solution will provide a more intuitive, efficient, and personalised search experience for users, allowing them to input requirements in a conversational manner.


**The potential impact of this project is significant:**

It could dramatically reduce the time and effort required for apartment hunting.

The platform may provide more personalized apartment recommendations, leading to better decisions for renters.

By addressing current pain points in apartment searching and leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, this project has the potential to significantly improve the apartment hunting experience for users.
